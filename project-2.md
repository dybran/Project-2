## LEMP STACK IMPLEMENTATION (PROJECT 2) ##

We are setting up a LEMP STACK using EC2,
to do this we need to do the following:

* create an account on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). 
* we create an instance (virtual machine) by selecting __“ubuntu server 20.04 LTS”__ from Amazon Machine Image(AMI)(free tier).
* we select “t2.micro(free tier eligible)” 
* then go to the security group and select “a security group” review and launch.

 How to create an aws free tier account. click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxKuB9kJoYM&list=PLtPuNR8I4TvkwU7Zu0l0G_uwtSUXLckvh&index=7)

This launches us into the instance as shown in the screenshot:

We open our terminal and go to the location of the previously downloaded PEM file:

To download PEM File from __AWS__. Click [here](https://intellipaat.com/community/52119/how-to-download-a-pem-file-from-aws).

We connect to the instance from our ubuntu terminal using the command:

```$ ssh -i dybran-ec2.pem ubuntu@54.175.190.127```

This automatically connects to the instance.

__SETTING UP NGINX WEB SERVER__

To download the nginx web server, we first update the server's package.

```$ sudo apt update```

![image](./images/update.PNG)

After the update, we then go ahead to install the nginx web server by running:

```$ sudo apt install nginx```

we click on "__y__" to confirm installation.

![image](./images/install-nginx.PNG)

To verify that nginx was downloaded and installed successfully, we run:

```$ sudo systemctl status nginx```

if it shows "__green__" and "__running__", then it was successfully installed.

![image](./images/nginx-status.PNG)

We then go to our instance and set the inbound rules and save

![image](./images/inbound-rulez.PNG)

To test how our nginx server responds to requests from the internet, we open our browser and use this url:

```http://<Public-IP-Address>:80```

![image](./images/nginx-on-browser.PNG)

__SETTING UP MYSQL DATABASE__

Now that we have our webserver up and running, we need a __Database Management System(DBMS)__.

To install Mysql server, we run the command:

```$ sudo apt install mysql-server```

![image](./images/mysql-install.PNG)

we click on "__y__" to confirm installation.

When installation is done, we log in by running the command:

```$ sudo mysql```

This will connect to the MySQL server as the administrative database user root:

![image](./images/sudo-mysql.PNG)

We run a security script that comes pre-installed with MySQL. This script will remove some insecure default settings and lock down access to your database system. Before running the script you will set a password for the root user, using __"mysql_native_password"__ as default authentication method. We choose a user’s password as __"PassWord.1"__.

```mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';```

![image](./images/alter-user.PNG)

We  __"exit"__ the mysql and start the script by running the command:

```$ sudo mysql_secure_installation```

This will ask for password, create password you would want and go ahead and type __"yes"__ to all subsequent prompts.

![image](./images/mysql_secure_install.PNG)

When we are done, we test if we can log into the  mysql by runnimg the command:

```$ sudo mysql -p```

there will be a prompt for you to put in the _password_ you created earlier.

![image](./images/logging-in-new-mysql-password.PNG)

Let us create a database named __"example_database"__ and a user named __"example_user"__, but you can replace these names with different values.

![image](./images/creating-example_database.PNG)

we then create the new user (__example_user__) and grant full priviledges on the database we just created by running the command:

```mysql> CREATE USER 'example_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '<new-password>';```

we replace __"new-password"__ by the new password we created earlier.

To give this user permission over the datatbase, we run the command:

```mysql> GRANT ALL ON example_database.* TO 'example_user'@'%';```

then __"exit"__.

![image](./images/configure-mysql-new-user.PNG)

we log into the mysql again with custom user credentials to test if the permissions were granted by running the command:

```$ sudo mysql -u example_user -p```

we put in our password at the prompt.

![image](./images/testing-new-user-permission.PNG)

Next, we run the command:

```mysql> SHOW DATABASES;```

![image](./images/show-database.PNG)

__SETTING UP PHP__

We have the _nginx server_ running for the web server and the _mysql_ to handle the database. we need to install _PHP_ to handle the codes.
To install PHP, we run the command:

```$ sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql```

we type __"y"__ at the prompt and click__"ENTER"__.

![image](./images/php-pkg-install.PNG)

__CONFIGURING NGINX TO USE PHP PROCESSOR__

To set up the nginx to use the PHP processor, we first create a root web directory by creating a directory in __"/var/www/"__.

```$ sudo mkdir /var/www/projectLEMP```

next we assign ownership to the directory

```$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectLEMP```

![image](./images/create-file-and-change-ownership.PNG)

create and open a new configuration file in nginx"s __sites-available__

```$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP```

paste in the following:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name projectLEMP www.projectLEMP;
    root /var/www/projectLEMP;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}
```

we click __"CTRL+"x"__ and then __"y"__ then __"ENTER"__.

![image](./images/create-file-sites-available.PNG)

in the above the php _7.4_ version  Make sure to specify the version of the PHP.
To check the PHP version we use the command:

```$ php -v```

To activate the configuration, we link to the configuration file in Nginx’s sites-enabled directory:

```$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/```

This will instruct the nginx to use the configuration next time it is loaded.
We then run the command:

```$ sudo nginx -t```

we will see the following:

> __nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful__

If it displays any errors, we go back and review the configurations.

To disable the default nginx host that is currently configured to listen on port 80

```$ sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default```

we reload nginx by running the command:

```$ sudo systemctl reload nginx```

![image](./images/linking-unlinking-reload.PNG)

The new website is now active, but the web root __"/var/www/projectLEMP"__ is still empty. 

We create an __"index.html"__ in the __"/var/www/projectLEMP"__ directory:

```
$ sudo echo 'Hello LEMP from hostname' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) 'with public IP' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) > /var/www/projectLEMP/index.html
```

We go to the browser and try to open the URL using IP address

```http://<Public-IP-Address>:80```

We should see the text from the __echo command__. This shows that the nginx site is working as expected.

__TESTING PHP WITH NGINX__

The LEMP stack is completely setup.
To test that the nginx can hand _.php_ files to PHP processor, we create a file __info.php__ in the __"/var/www/PROJECTLEMP"__ 

```$ sudo nano /var/www/projectLEMP/info.php```

and paste the following:
```
<?php
phpinfo();
```
![image](./images/info-about-php.PNG)

We can now access this by adding __info.php__ to the URL on the browser

```http://<Public-IP-Address>/info.php```

wWe should see a web page containing information about PHP

![image](./images/php-info.PNG)

To create a test table, we log into the mysql:

```$ mysql -u example_user -p```

We log in using our password.

Next, we run the command:

```mysql> SHOW DATABASES;```

This will give the following output

```
 Output
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| example_database   |
| information_schema |
+--------------------+
2 rows in set (0.000 sec)
```

Next, we create a test table named __todo_list.php__

```
mysql> CREATE TABLE example_database.todo_list (
mysql>     item_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
mysql>     content VARCHAR(255),
mysql>     PRIMARY KEY(item_id)
mysql> );
```

![image](./images/creating-test-table-todolist.PNG)

we insert a few rows using the command:

```
mysql> INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list (content) VALUES ("My first important item");
```
and 
```
mysql> INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list (content) VALUES ("another important item");
```
and 
```
mysql> INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list (content) VALUES ("just another important item");
```
and
```
mysql> INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list (content) VALUES ("an important item");
```

we click on __ENTER__ after each of the above commands.

![image](./images/insert-test-tables.PNG)

To confirm the values were succesfully stored in the table, we run the command:

```mysql>  SELECT * FROM example_database.todo_list;```

The following output will be displayed.

![image](./images/insert-rows-and-check-if-saved.PNG)

Now we create a PHP script that will connect to mysql:

```$ nano /var/www/projectLEMP/todo_list.php```

we paste the following into the above file:

```
<?php
$user = "example_user";
$password = "password";
$database = "example_database";
$table = "todo_list";

try {
  $db = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=$database", $user, $password);
  echo "<h2>TODO</h2><ol>";
  foreach($db->query("SELECT content FROM $table") as $row) {
    echo "<li>" . $row['content'] . "</li>";
  }
  echo "</ol>";
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    print "Error!: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>";
    die();
}
```

in the __$password = "password"__, we replace __password__ with our own _password_.

We save and close the file.

![image](./images/ppp.PNG)

we can now access the page using:

```http://<Public-IP-Address>/info.php```

we should see this display ![image](./images/todo-list-on-browser.PNG)

__This means that the PHP Environment can now connect and interact with mysql server__.
